# Reverse_web_proxy_LDAP
Reverse TLS web proxy with LDAP authentication

The reverse web proxy with LDAP authentication was developed because the Safari browser 
in iOS can't save and remember passwords when basic authentication is used on a web site.

Basic authentication is used in: https://github.com/hansake/Reverse_web_proxy.
